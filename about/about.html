              <h2>Interview with Chris Somsak</h2>
              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What is your favorite childhood memory, and why does it stand out to you?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>Given the context of what my good friend thinks of me.
                  I will discuss an early memory of me "upgrading" the family computer with more memory
                  and a new GFX card.  My mother freaked out, and I, in a calming manner, stated that
                  I knew what I was doing because "a friend told me how to do it."
                  This was likely on an early i386, adding a sound card and an early-gen EVGA-capable card.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What was the first video game you ever played, and what do you remember most about it?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>There were a few on the Apple II+, but what I recall with a title was Temple of Apshai.
                  A simplistic dungeon crawler in 2D, moving N/S/E/W to work through a maze and using text-based instructions.
                  This was pre-ZORK and nothing graphical other than a simple 2D maze and character movement</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>There are so many places I still want to see, but I would most like to see ancient Rome and Greece;
                  the first bastions of true civilization are what I would like to see and experience.
                  After that, I would like to see the beginnings of culture in Venice and Paris.
                  I've seen the early imperialism of Prague and central Europe along the Danube, but there is so much more to see.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>Besides gaming, what are some of your other hobbies or interests that you are passionate about?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>My interests outside gaming involve Family (specifically my immediate children and grandkids), travel, snorkeling (a few times so far), investing, and my local neighborhood of families. My early childhood had a strong local "street" community of families, and I am working to continue to build that locally among my neighbors.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>Who has had the most significant impact on your life, both personally and in your interest in gaming or technology?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>In my life, in general, my father was my most significant role model. In gaming, there is no singular influence. It was a common interest amongst my friends from early ages through my adult life. I have connected both personally and professionally with like-minded individuals to grow my online persona and interests.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What is a book or movie that has deeply influenced you, and do you think it would make a good video game adaptation?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>My personal favorite book is Enders's Game, and the movie would have to be the original Dune. Both have impacted me in my personality by striving to be what I am meant to be. Not necessarily with others or the world thinks I should be. My own fate, my own responsibility for myself and my family.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What are some of your personal goals or dreams for the future, both in life and in your gaming or tech pursuits?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>At nearly 50 I am mostly focused on financial sustainability not only for myself but for my wife and my future generations (kids and grandkids). I want to not only enjoy my 55+ years in style and excess but also provide a solid start for their "real adult" future. In this current age that is delayed a solid 5-10+ years, but I want to make sure they have the best possible start.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>Can you share a challenging experience you have faced, in gaming or otherwise, and how you overcame it?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>Moving across the country for a job opportunity has been a great challenge in the last 10 years. My wife and I were going through a rough time, and I think this move not only strengthened us but perhaps saved our marriage. We were struggling in So. Cal. with a small home and 4 young kids. I was unhappy in my work life and more concerned with my own sanity and happiness, and she struggled as a recently married woman with a mixed family of 4 little kids and a house to manage.</p>

              <div class="qa">
                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What is something you have always wanted to learn or try, both in general and in the realm of computing or gaming?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>I suppose one of my regrets in learning was to complete my college degree, even though it tends to mean less and less every year. I have been blessed to move forward in different positions although I see it could potentially hold me back from future advancement. </p>

                <p><strong class="si1">Interviewer: </strong>What qualities do you value most in friends and relationships, and do you find these qualities in your gaming communities as well?</p>
                <p><strong class="si2">Chris: </strong>The qualities I most value are honesty and support when needed. My friends are my sounding board for the simple and complex conversations that are required as a man. My gaming bros are a side community for fun and bullshit. There are few I consider true friends, those I can confide in and have conversations about anything with.</p>
